I"x<p><em>Author’s note - kept for nostalgia</em></p>

<p>Today sees the launch of jaredrigby.co.uk. My personal site powered by a Raspberry Pi!</p>

<p>The site will act as a development portfolio of sorts and also an opportunity for me to share what I’m currently coding as professional work or what I’ve made as a personal project.</p>

<p>Everything you see is brand new and coded by hand in Notepad++ so please bear with me while I go over the site with a fine tooth comb ensuring that every link works as expected etc…</p>

<p>I can’t wait to start sharing what I’m up to!</p>

<p>Until next time,</p>

<p>Jared.</p>
