I"@<p>I’m Jared Rigby, a freelance web developer living and working in Ramsbottom.</p>

<p>You’ll find me mostly working on frontend development (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript) and responsive design projects. I’m also making a concious effort to involve myself more with the community at large so you may bump into me from time to time at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/McrFRED/">Manchester FRED</a>, <a href="https://mwug.uk/">MWUG</a> or offering my 2 cents in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/webfreelancershub/">Freelancers’ Hub</a>.</p>

<p>Since 2013 I’ve been running my independent development studio <a href="http://www.mtddigital.uk/">MTD Digital</a> where I’ve had the opportunity to collaborate with a number of award winning digital agencies nationwide on projects spanning a whole range of sectors.</p>
