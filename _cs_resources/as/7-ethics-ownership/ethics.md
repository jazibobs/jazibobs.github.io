## What do we mean by ethics?
The idea of ethics relates to the concept of right and wrong. Ethics do not necessarily relate to whether an action is legal.

For example, it is possible to act unethically without breaking the law.

In computer science, ethics relates to using technology in a morally sound way. This relates to both your day to day use of computers and points to consider when building software.

## The software engineering code of ethics
The software engineering code of ethics was written in 1997 by the Associatation for Computing Machinery (ACM) and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).

The code consists of 8 main sections with a number of sub-sections.

## The 8 main sections
1. **Public** - Software engineers should act with the public's best interest in mind.

2. **Client and Employer** - Software engineers should act in the interest of their employer and client (*as long as their interests are consistent with the publicâ€™s interests)*.

3. **Product** - Software engineers should make sure that the products they are building meet the highest possible standards.

4. **Judgement** - Software engineers should maintain the integrity and independence of their own professional judgement.

5. **Management** - Software engineering managers and leaders should promote an ethical approach to management of software development and software maintenance.

6. **Profession** - Software engineers should work to advance the integrity and reputation of the profession.

7. **Colleagues** - Software engineers should be fair and supportive towards their colleagues.

8. **Self** - Software engineers should participate in lifelong learning about their profession and should always promote an ethical approach within their profession.
