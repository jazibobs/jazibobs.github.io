## Software licenses

When someone purchases a piece of software, they do not own the software itself, but rather a license for that piece of software.

A software license is a legally binding between the software creator and the end-user. This agreement explains the ‘terms of service’ for that piece of software. All software must be legally licensed before it may be installed.

There are many different types of software licenses that can be categorised as follows:

### Proprietary software
Proprietary software is licensed by the copyright holder under very specific conditions. 

You are allowed to use the software, but you are not allowed to modify the software or share it with others.

Many pieces of propriety software are also known as commercial software, meaning that users must pay for a license.

### Freeware
Freeware is very similar to proprietary software but there is no cost to the user.

Just like proprietary software, you are allowed to use the software, but you are not allowed to modify the software or share it with others.

Examples include: Google Chrome and the messaging system Discord.

### Open Source Software
Open source software is software where the application and the source code are released at no cost.

Users of this software are free to copy, modify and distribute the software as they see fit.

### Free Software
> *Free as in freedom, not free as in free beer*

Free software is mostly similar to open source software.

The main difference is that modifications made must also be released with the same terms of use it originally had, in practice this means that any changes you make to a piece of Free Software should be shared back with the community for them to freely use and build upon.

### Shareware
Shareware is software that is free to try.

Users then usually have to pay if they want to continue using the software.
