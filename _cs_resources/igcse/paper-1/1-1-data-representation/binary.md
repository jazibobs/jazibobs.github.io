## Binary key terms

> - **Bit**​ - This is the name for a single binary digit (e.g. 0 or 1)​
> - **Byte**​ - A byte is the name given to 8 bits​
> - **Nibble**​ - A nibble is half a byte (4 bits)

## What is denary?
Denary (also known as base-10) is the name of the number system you use every day​, it uses the numbers 0 to 9​.

Examples of denary numbers include 5, 12, 137 and lots of other examples!​

## What is binary?
Binary (also known as base-2) is a number system which only uses `0s` and `1s`​.

This is a useful number system to use in computer science as a computer is made from millions of tiny switches which can only be `ON` or `OFF`​.

This means we can easily match the state of the computer to a binary value​:

- A switch set to `ON` equals `1`
- A switch set to `OFF` equals `0`

## Example of a binary number

Consider the 8-bit number `11101110`, this can be re-written in a table as follows:

| 128 | 64 | 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 |

The value of this binary number can be calculated by adding together the place values of bits equal to 1.

`128 + 64 + 32 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 238`
