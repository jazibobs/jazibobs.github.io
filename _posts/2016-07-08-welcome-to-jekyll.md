And now for something completely different, plus it only took 4 commands to get up and running (assuming you have ruby and rubygems installed on your system of course).

{% highlight bash %}

$ gem install jekyll
$ jekyll new jaredrigby
$ cd jaredrigby
~/jaredrigby $ jekyll serve

# local jekyll site running on localhost:4000

{% endhighlight %}

Today marks the first time I've built a site using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (I know I'm about 3 years late to the party) and I have to say it's been a plesure.

Having an in-built SASS compiler greatly reduces the set up time required for build processes - I completely omitted my build tools from this project - and being able to mark up template designs without the ugliness of PHP and the WordPress loop can only be positive.

Admittedly, Jekyll seems to have a only a limited number applications, the only one that honestly comes to mind is a site for a developer! Seeing as it's lacking a traditional backend for content management a Jeykll site would be a hard sell even to the savviest of customers.
