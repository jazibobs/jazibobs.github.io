After a recent parents meeting with my students. I found myself giving the same piece of advice over and over. If they want to develop their programming skills they must practice more often than the time I give them in class. It is similar to playing an instrument or learning a foreign language, small and regular practice will help to quickly develop skills in the long term.

However, since finishing my MSc in December 2020, I've found myself not following my own advice or finding the time to develop my own skills in computer science. To remedy this, starting during my schools Chinese New Year break I have decided to complete the [#100daysofcode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) challenge.

The two main rules being:

1. Code for a minimum of an hour every day for the next 100 days
2. Tweet about your progress each day

## 100 days of code

### Day 1 - 30 Jan 2022

I investigated potential resources to use with my IGCSE computer science students during our upcoming security unit. During which, I found and completed all challenges for the most recent Beginner picoMini event run by CMU. I think the students will enjoy working through these challenges in the next few weeks.

### Day 2 - 31 Jan 2022

As part of my exploration I worked through a serious of tutorial videos by [Andy the GDScript Dude](https://gdscript.com/) to learn more about the Godot game engine. With his guidance, I have recently completed a bare bones Tetris clone.
