This is my second post in the [#100daysofcode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) challenge series. On this page I will detail what I have covered during days 11 to 20.

A reminder of the rules for the challenge:

1. Code for a minimum of an hour every day for the next 100 days
2. Tweet about your progress each day [(follow me @jazibobs)](https://twitter.com/jazibobs)

### Day 11 - 9 Feb 2022

After building a simple Android shooter game using Godot last week, I thought I would challenge myself to build a simple online multiplayer game. I spent today working through an excellent tutorial by [Game Development Center](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClseGZiVmeHamsjYmpbiAmQ) on YouTube and got simple client and server projects up and running.
