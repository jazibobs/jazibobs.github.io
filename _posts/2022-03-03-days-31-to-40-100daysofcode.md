This is my third post in the [#100daysofcode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) challenge series. On this page I will detail what I have covered during days 31 to 40.

A reminder of the rules for the challenge:

1. Code for a minimum of an hour every day for the next 100 days
2. Tweet about your progress each day [(follow me @jazibobs)](https://twitter.com/jazibobs)

### Day 31 - 1 Mar 2022

Continued to work on my data visualization project for [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) as part of the D3 unit of work. I managed to import all data into the project, create and label my axes and colour coded all sections based on temperature variance.

I will need to finish building the tooltip system tomorrow.

### Day 32 - 2 Mar 2022

Managed to complete the third data visualization project for [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org). The completed codepen for this project can be found here:

### Day 33 - 3 Mar 2022

Spent time developing my personal website. I noticed I'd been neglecting to update my side with my daily programming tasks so spent my time working in Jekyll to ensure that all parts of this process were up to date. The current posts relating to #100DaysOfCode can be found here:
