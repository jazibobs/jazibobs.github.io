This is my sixth post in the [#100daysofcode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) challenge series. On this page I will detail what I have covered during days 61 to 70.

A reminder of the rules for the challenge:

1. Code for a minimum of an hour every day for the next 100 days
2. Tweet about your progress each day [(follow me @jazibobs)](https://twitter.com/jazibobs)

### Day 61 - 31 Mar 2022

Continued work on my [LD50 game Monster Match](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/50/monster-match), created multiple levels which build in difficulty today.

Worked on improving the UI of my match 3 game. The monster approaches the city as time runs out during the level.
