This is my seventh post in the [#100daysofcode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) challenge series. On this page I will detail what I have covered during days 71 to 80.

A reminder of the rules for the challenge:

1. Code for a minimum of an hour every day for the next 100 days
2. Tweet about your progress each day [(follow me @jazibobs)](https://twitter.com/jazibobs)

### Day 71 - 10 Apr 2022

Spent some time adding Open Graph tags to the Jekyll template that powers this site. From now on, any links shared on social media should be rendered with a lovely preview of the content.

Here's an example from Twitter:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Day 71 of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/100DaysOfCode?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#100DaysOfCode</a> - Finally got round to adding OpenGraph tags to my personal website. Hopefully the social media previews will be a little bit more beautiful from now on...<a href="https://t.co/TjDsOnr5ZF">https://t.co/TjDsOnr5ZF</a></p>&mdash; Jared Rigby 💻 (@jazibobs) <a href="https://twitter.com/jazibobs/status/1513170846050828291?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 10, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
