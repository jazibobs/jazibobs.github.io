This is my seventh post in the [#100daysofcode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) challenge series. On this page I will detail what I have covered during days 71 to 80.

A reminder of the rules for the challenge:

1. Code for a minimum of an hour every day for the next 100 days
2. Tweet about your progress each day [(follow me @jazibobs)](https://twitter.com/jazibobs)

### Day 71 - 10 Apr 2022

Spent some time adding OpenGraph tags to the Jekyll template that powers this site. From now on, any links shared on social media should be rendered with a lovely preview of the content.

Here's an example from Twitter:
