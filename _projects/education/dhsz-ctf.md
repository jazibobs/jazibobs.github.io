As the leader of the my school's competitive programming competitions I'm always thinking of ways to challenge the students in new ways.

The 2021 edition of the DHSZ Coding Competition saw the students work through a number of 'hacking' style challenges in addition to the standard competitive programming aspects.

Students competed in groups of 8 and had 2 hours to complete 20 independent computer science related trials. Students were tested on their knowledge of:

- Data compression
- File formats
- Metadata
- Python programming
- Steganography
- Website development

...and much, much more!
