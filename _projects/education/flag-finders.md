The world is facing a skills gap in terms of cyber security. Globally there is a workforce gap of over 4 million people in cyber security.

A common issue is that students do not know these jobs exist, most cyber security courses only begin at university level. We want to give younger students a chance to experience the world of cyber security.

CTF (capture the flag) is a type of learning game for cyber security, users are tasked with finding 'flags' hidden within a system which contains in-built vulnerabilities.

Flag Finders will provide level appropriate challenges for students who are new to cyber security so they are prepared to protect systems in the future.
