[Hello World](https://helloworld.raspberrypi.org/) is a computer science education magazine published every few months by the [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://raspberrypi.org/).

I was lucky enough to be a contributing author for issue 17 of the magazine (October 2021), where I shared my experiences in teaching with a *Gameful* pedagogy - i.e. setting up classwork and assignments using aspects of game design.

The key ideas from game design you can include within a classroom include:

- Clear learning goals
- Identity play (for example, have students pretend to be members of an R&D department)
- Embedded assessment
- Intrinsic and extrinsic motivators
- Supporting student autonomy
- Encouraging belonging and community
- Supporting competence in a new skill
- Making failures productive
- Encouraging exploration
- Practice and reinforcement
