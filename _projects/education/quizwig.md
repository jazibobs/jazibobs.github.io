QuizWig began as my final project for my MSc in Advanced Computer Science for the University of Leicester.

Between February 2020 to October 2020 I developed a classroom based learning game where students could complete in real-time
at custom built quizzes.

Features included:

- Live scoreboards during games
- Rewards/badge system for players
- Automatic scaling difficulty for players
- Feedback reports generated for all students and their teachers

After a short hiatus from the project to concentrate on the start of the new academic year development of QuizWig v2 is now
underway.

I'm hoping to have a beta of the new site up and running before the end of 2021.
