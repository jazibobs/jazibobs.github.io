This project takes inspiration from [JamesT107's work from Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-FightStick/).

After learning about the new Raspberry Pi Pico micro-controller board I wanted to try my hand at creating a hardware project.

My strengths have traditionally been in software and I would not call myself a maker (until recently). 

So armed with the Pi, a horribly cheap soldering iron and a dream I set to work on creating my own USB HitBox fighting game controller.

Full write-up coming soon...
