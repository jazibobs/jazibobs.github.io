An endless runner built using Unity for the GMTK 2021 Game Jam.

This game jam challenged entrants to design and build a completely new game within 48 hours which relates to a theme.

For this year's theme - **joined together** - I created a system were an escaping convict is handcuffed to a guard at the top of the level. The guard will randomly move backwards and forwards pulling the player along with him. This can be a hindrance or helpful depending on how far you plan ahead!

This project was built over 2 days using the Unity game engine.

A version exported as a WebGL project is playable online on itch.io:
