A puzzle game created for [Ludum Dare 50](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/50/$278125)

This weekend game jam required entrants to follow the theme: "Delay the inevitable".

A monster is coming to destroy the city. Only by matching sets of 3 or more coloured blocks can you delay the attack.

This project was built over 3 days using the Godot game engine.

The game has been released as a [HTML5 game on itch.io](https://jazibobs.itch.io/monster-match) and will soon available for android on the Google Play store.

[ElysiaGriffin](https://www.twitch.tv/elysiagriffin) was kind enough to feature my game as part of her LD50 Twitch stream. Thanks to Elysia and her channel for some really useful feedback on what to improve.
