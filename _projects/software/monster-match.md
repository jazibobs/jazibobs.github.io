This weekend game jam required entrants to follow the theme: "Delay the inevitable".

A monster is coming to destroy the city. Only by matching sets of 3 or more coloured blocks can you delay the attack.

This project was built over 3 days using the Godot game engine.

The game has been released as a [HTML5 game on itch.io](https://jazibobs.itch.io/monster-match) and will soon available for android on the Google Play store.
