A puzzle game created for [Black and White Jam #8](https://itch.io/jam/black-and-white-jam-8/rate/1477823)

This game jam required entrants to build a completely black and white game which followed the theme: "Loop".

I created a ambient, looping, puzzle game loosely inspired by electroplankton.

This project was built over 5 days using the Godot game engine.

The game has been released as a [HTML5 game on itch.io](https://jazibobs.itch.io/tonalities) and is available for Android, Windows, Mac and Linux devices.
