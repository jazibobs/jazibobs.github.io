I'm Jared Rigby, a freelance web developer living and working in Ramsbottom. 

You'll find me mostly working on frontend development (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript) and responsive design projects. I'm also making a concious effort to involve myself more with the community at large so you may bump into me from time to time at [Manchester FRED](http://www.meetup.com/McrFRED/), [MWUG](https://mwug.uk/) or offering my 2 cents in the [Freelancers' Hub](https://www.facebook.com/groups/webfreelancershub/).

Since 2013 I've been running my independent development studio [MTD Digital](http://www.mtddigital.uk/) where I've had the opportunity to collaborate with a number of award winning digital agencies nationwide on projects spanning a whole range of sectors.
