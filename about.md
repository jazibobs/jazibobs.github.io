I'm Jared Rigby, a computer scientist living and working in China. 

I've been employed by Dulwich International High School Suzhou since 2017 and where I teach IGCSE and AS/A2 computer science.

Prior to this I was a full-stack web developer based in Manchester in the U.K.

On this site you will find my ramblings about technology tools and resources for teaching computer science concepts.
