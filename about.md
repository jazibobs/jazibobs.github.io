I'm Jared Rigby, a freelance web developer living and working in Ramsbottom. Since 2013 I've been running my independent development studio [MTD Digital](http://www.mtddigital.uk/).

I'm currently working mostly on frontend development (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript) and responsive design. I'm also making a concious effort to involve myself more with the community at large so you may bump into me from time to time at [MWUG](https://mwug.uk/) or offering my 2 cents in the [Freelancers' Hub](https://www.facebook.com/groups/webfreelancershub/).
